I had issues with this project when opened it on my 
laptop instead of my computer everything looked out of place.

The main part I struggled with is positioning the two 
elements on the top of the landing page. Named landing-left
& landing right.

I was unable to move the shop now button and the text above
together so I resulted in putting a margin between the two
elements to move the text up by itself to be as similar as
possible to the mock up

I managed to fix most positioning issues once flex was used.

To ensure my websites and applications are going to look
accurate on other devices I keep an eye on responsive layout
